You can use a string, or a Buffer. For example:\n    ```\n    lcd.write('Hooray');\n    lcd.write(new Buffer([0xFE, 0x01]));\n    ```\n\n* `clearScreen`: Clears the screen.\n* `clearAndWrite`: Clears the screen (resetting the cursor position to 0), then writes a string/buffer.\n* `writeTopLine`: Reset the cursor to the top line and write a string (not a buffer) to the top line (without removing the bottom line).\n* `writeBottomLine`: Reset the cursor to the bottom line and write a string (not a buffer) to the bottom line (without removing the top line).\n* `backlightOff`: Turn the backlight off.\n* `backlight40`: Set backlight to 40%\n* `backlight73`: Set backlight to 73%\n* `backlight100`: Set backlight to 100% (max brightness)\n\n\n\n## TODO/Not implemented\n\n* Move cursor left\n* Move cursor right\n* Scroll left\n* Scroll right\n* Turn visual display on\n* Turn visual display off\n* Underline cursor on\n* Underline cursor off\n* Blinking box cursor on\n* Blinking box cursor off\n* Set arbitrary cursor position",
